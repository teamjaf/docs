## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Exists

I created this project as both a **personal knowledge base** and a **public resource** for learners, engineers, and researchers who want to go deep â€” without getting lost.

Although I come from a **cybersecurity background**, Iâ€™ve always been passionate about **building AI products** and pushing forward **AI research**.

Built by [**Mohammad Jafrin Hossain**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-jafrin-hossain/) â€” lifelong learner, security, and AI enthusiast.

Whether you're starting out or diving into advanced models, this path helps you learn faster, stay focused, and build real expertise.

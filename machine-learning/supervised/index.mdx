# ðŸ“˜ Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn a mapping from inputs $x$ to outputs $y$ using labeled training data. Each example in the training set is a pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, and the goal is to learn a function $f(x)$ that generalizes to new unseen examples.

## Types

Supervised learning problems fall into two major types:

- **Regression**: Predicts continuous numeric values.
- **Classification**: Predicts categorical or discrete labels.

## Algorithms

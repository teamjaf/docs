# ðŸ“˜ Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn a mapping from inputs $x$ to outputs $y$ using labeled training data. Each example in the training set is a pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, and the goal is to learn a function $f(x)$ that generalizes to new unseen examples.

## Common Algorithms

- [Linear Regression](./linear-regression)
- [Logistic Regression](./logistic-regression)

- [Decision Tree](./decision-tree)
- [Random Forest](./random-forest)
- [Support Vector Machine](./svm)
- [k-Nearest Neighbors](./k-nearest-neighbors)
- [Naive Bayes](./naive-bayes)
- [Gradient Boosting](./gradient-boosting)

These pages dive into the mathematics, intuition, and practical implementation of each method.

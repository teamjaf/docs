# ü§ù k-Nearest Neighbors

<img src="../../images/supervised/knn.svg" alt="k-NN icon" width="80" />

k-NN classifies a point by the majority label of its $k$ closest examples.

## Mathematics

Given a distance metric $d$, predict

$$
\hat{y} = \operatorname{mode}(y_i \text{ for } i \in N_k(x)),
$$

where $N_k(x)$ are the indices of the $k$ nearest neighbors of $x$.

## Example (scikit-learn)

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X, y)
```

## Use Case Example

Recommending products based on similar users.

## Recommendations

- Choose $k$ via cross-validation.
- Scale features for Euclidean distance.
- See the [scikit-learn guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) for more.

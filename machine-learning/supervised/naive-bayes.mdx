<img src="../../images/supervised/naive-bayes.svg" alt="Naive Bayes icon" width="80" />

Naive Bayes uses Bayes' theorem with the assumption that features are conditionally independent given the class.

## Mathematics

$$
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) \propto P(y) \prod_{j=1}^n P(x_j \mid y).
$$

## Example (scikit-learn)

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X, y)
```

## Use Case Example

Classifying news articles into topics.

## Recommendations

- Works well with high-dimensional data like text.
- Assumes feature independence; may underperform if features correlate.
- See the [scikit-learn guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html) for more.
